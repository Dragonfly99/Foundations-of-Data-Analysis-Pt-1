# Foundations-of-Data-Analysis-Pt-1

In order for me to improve my analysis and become a better data scientist, I am going through this UTAustinX edx course. Though archived so I won't receieve a grade, I believe the knowlede to be extremely useful. I will be adding my own twists to the labs however.

I will be using packages like dplyr and ggplot2 so that I may continue to practice the skills I started learning while I learn the statistical ones. 

I hope you may enjoy seeing my takes as well as my growth
